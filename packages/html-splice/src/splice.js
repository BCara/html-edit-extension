/*
 * Quick Edit — write-back.
 *
 * The saved file is the ORIGINAL source string with a handful of character
 * ranges replaced. It is never produced by serialising the DOM. That is the
 * whole point of the extension: serialising would re-indent the file, drop
 * comments, normalise attribute quoting and rewrite entities, none of which the
 * user asked for.
 *
 * Two rules keep that promise:
 *   1. Only spans belonging to text nodes the user actually changed are in the
 *      edit list. An untouched file produces an empty edit list, and an empty
 *      edit list returns the source unchanged — byte for byte, by construction.
 *   2. Edits are non-overlapping and applied against the ORIGINAL offsets.

   * the file parses are encoded, plus U+00A0, which is encoded because a raw
   * non-breaking space is invisible in an editor and easy to mangle later.
   * Everything else is written through as-is: the file is UTF-8 and stays UTF-8.
   *
   * ">" is not strictly required in text content, but is encoded anyway so that
   * a typed "]]>" or "-->" cannot combine with surrounding markup.
   *
   * Note the one-way trip this implies: a span originally written as "&#39;" or
   * "&quot;" decodes to "'" / '"' and, IF THE USER EDITS THAT SPAN, is written
   * back as the bare character. Only spans the user edited are affected; this
   * is documented in the README as a known limitation.
