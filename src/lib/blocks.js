/*
 * Quick Edit — adding a block.
 *
 * Everything here is about answering one question: if the user asks for "another
 * one of these", what exactly gets written into the file, and at which offset?
 *
 * An insertion is a ZERO-LENGTH splice. Nothing existing is replaced, so the
 * promise holds unchanged: every byte that was there before is still there,
 * with a new run of text sitting between two of them. Because nothing is
 * written until save, an insertion also cannot invalidate any other offset —
 * every edit is still measured against the original source.
 *
 * The anchor is derived from the element map (mapping.js), which knows where
 * each element's tags sit in the file.
